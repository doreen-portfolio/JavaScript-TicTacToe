JavaScriptTicTacToe
===================

This interactive tic-tac-toe game was created by me in an introductory web development course using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can drag images onto a 3x3 grid. The winner is declared when 3 of the same images are inline horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Other features include:

* The background of a square changes colour when an image is dropped into it.
* The order of turns is controlled so that each player can only make one move at a time.
* Images cannot be dragged on top of one another.
